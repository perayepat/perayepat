### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Mphathi
#### I'm  a Developer

Motivated by creativity and people that I am around, I have a desire to improve my work in both quality and aesthetic. I am a game developer graduate and this degree has taught me the steps to become a better programmer and designer by both introducing and reinforcing the qualities and mindset of what it means to work in both a programming and design field. I have an affinity for design.

 But I am more drawn to programming as I do like adding functionality to a beautiful form.
